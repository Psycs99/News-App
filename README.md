# News-App
This is a news application, which makes a request to a news provider to later show them on a page dedicated to you, 
and another section for you to navigate between the news you want to see.

Also here you will have to have your apiKey for it to work, and the images that I uploaded, 
the news is not visible, because my api key has expired, or I don't know what really happened, 
but the news appears in a list, you can see the complete code and use it if you wish.

This application was developed during the Udemy Flutter course.
